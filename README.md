# OOTP Logo Maker

I've been asked numerous times if I would ever consider making this.

At long last, a cross-platform tool to help you make logos for OOTP Baseball

- 5 different logo "shapes" to choose from.
- 3 different gloss overlay styles to choose from.
- 22 different background patterns to choose from, or you can add your own.
- 68 font options to choose from, or you can add your own.

Most of the the stock elements can be customized - change sizes, colors, and angles on pretty much everything, and you can even scale the background patterns to your liking.

If you've used any of my other apps over the years, you'll already have a pretty good idea how this works.
